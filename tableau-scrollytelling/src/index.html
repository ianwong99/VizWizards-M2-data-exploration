        <p>
            In the late 1990s and early 2000s, NBA offenses operated primarily inside the arc.
            This visualization shows dense clusters of shots in the mid-range and paint-reflecting
            a style of play centered on post-ups, isolations, and high-percentage two-pointers.
            The three-point line existed, but it wasn’t yet a major strategic weapon.

        <p>
            As the league progressed into the 2000s and 2010s, teams began to embrace floor spacing
            and the value of the three-point shot. In this visualization, you can see attempts expanding
            far beyond the arc, marking the early stages of the perimeter revolution. By the 2010s,
            the perimeter becomes densely populated, illustrating how analytics reshaped offensive
            priorities across the NBA.

                <p>
                    Finally, we turn to the economics of professional basketball by examining how player compensation relates to shooting performance.
                    In the top visualization, player salaries for each season are grouped into bins based on 3-point percentage (3P%),
                    allowing you to compare how shooting efficiency aligns with pay within any given year.
                    The bottom visualization shows how average salaries have evolved over time across the league.

                <p>
                    As expected, overall player salaries rise steadily across the years, but an interesting pattern emerges after roughly 2015:
                    higher-earning players increasingly cluster in the upper 3P% bins.
                    In other words, the modern NBA places a growing premium on perimeter shooting,
                    and many of the league's top earners consistently shoot above 30% from three.
                    <br><br>
                    However, this trend does not apply uniformly across all positions.
                    For example, traditional centers (C) typically attempt fewer three-point shots, so their salary is less correlated with 3P%.
                    The interactive position filter allows you to highlight or exclude specific roles to better explore these nuances and isolate position-specific salary dynamics.
